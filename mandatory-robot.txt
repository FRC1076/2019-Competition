The following are electrical and hardware requirements as specified by software team.
(refine these/expand on them)

1. Dual sonar mounts on front of robot in a position that will permit the sonar to
   determine if the robot is square to the pickup delivery points.
    a. mounts
    b. 5v power connection to Arduino
    c. 3wires from Arduino to each of the sonar units  (see software for wiring diagram)

2. Proximity sensor to detect if the elevator is all the way at the bottom.
   Check wiring, wire to RoboRio digital pins as appropriate.    Tell us what pin.
   You'll need to read the specs on that 

3. NeoMatrix panels 4 on each side of the robot, each side powered by 5v supply and
   controlled by an arduino mega with ethernet shield

4. Encoder mounted on the elevator drivetrain.  (need breakout connected to a motor
   controller powering the elevator.)

5. Drivercamera, wired into ethernet hub.  Powered by 5v phone charger battery.
   (need mounting places for both)
   Drivercamera must be able to see when delivering hatch and/or ball.
   It can be used for alignment, so should be able to see the floor in front of the robot.

6. 5 port ethernet hub (powered by 5v, 3.5 mm Barrel connector)

7. Motor controller ID assignments:
    
    Can ID for drivetrain:
    
      Left Side:
      
     Left Side:    1, 2, 3  (1 is master, 3 is the Victor)
     Right Side:   4, 5, 6  (4 is master, 6 is the Victor)
     Elevator:     7, 8     (encoder breakout from 7)
     Ball Intake   9
       
     Pneumatics:
            1,2:     Hatchgrabber
            3,4:     Deploy Intake forward
            5,6:     LeftFront piston
            7,8:     RightFront piston
            9,10:    RightRear piston
            11,12:   LeftRear piston
