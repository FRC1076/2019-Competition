Printed versions of this document are considered obsolete.

The following are electrical and hardware requirements as specified by software team.
(refine these/expand on them)

1. Dual sonar mounts on front of robot in a position that will permit the sonar to
   determine if the robot is square to the pickup delivery points.
    a. mounts
    b. three wires each, to Rio (5v power, ground, and to an analog input pin)

2. Limit switch to stop downward elevator motion.   This should be wired to the
   reverse limit switch pin of the master elevator drive motor controller #7 breakout.
   That is, unless motor forward drives the elevator down, then, instead is should be
   connected to the forward limit switch.

3. scratch lights.  No weight allowance for them.

4. Encoder mounted on the elevator drivetrain.  (need breakout connected to a motor
   controller powering the elevator #7.)    Need this soon, so we can debug this code.

5. Drivercamera, wired into ethernet hub.  Powered by 5v phone charger battery.
   (need mounting places for both battery and the Pi case/camera.)
   
   Drivercamera must be able to see when delivering hatch and/or ball.
   It can be used for alignment, so should be able to see the floor in front of the robot.
   
   Does it need a fisheye lens in order to do that?
   
6. Sony eyecam pointed at the floor at center axis to support line following/alignment.
   May prefer pointing at vision targets.   Will need a light ring if that is the case, though.

7. 5 port ethernet hub (powered by 5v, 3.5 mm Barrel connector, rated at 600 milliamps)
   We need to be able to access the ports.  

8. Motor controller ID assignments to be set/wired before giving the robot to software.
    
    Can ID for drivetrain:  (post weight-loss program)
      
     Left Side:    1, 2  (1 is master, 2 is follower)
     Right Side:   4, 5  (4 is master, 5 is follower)
     Elevator:     7, 8  (encoder breakout from 7, also for limit switch (at bottom))
     Ball Intake   9
       
     Pneumatics: (module: extend, retract)
            0: 0,1:     Front pistons (ganged left and right)
            0: 2,3:     Rear pistons (ganged left and right)
            0: 4,5:     Deploy Intake
            0: 6,7:     Hatchgrabber
