Printed versions of this document are considered obsolete.

The following are electrical and hardware requirements as specified by software team.
(refine these/expand on them)

Reordered in priority order.

1. 5 port ethernet hub (powered by 5v, 3.5 mm Barrel connector, rated at 600 milliamps)
   We need to be able to access the ports.    Port access needs improvement.

2. Drivercamera, wired into ethernet hub.  Powered by 5v phone charger battery.
   (need mounting places for both battery and the Pi case/camera.)
   
   Drivercamera must be able to see when delivering hatch and/or ball.
   It can be used for alignment, so should be able to see the floor in front of the robot.
   
   Does it need a fisheye lens in order to do that?  (yes, there is now a spare lens, too)
   
3. Downward facing simple sonar unit (wired over 4-wire cable through the cable management.)
   This is to be connected to Arduino and then Ethernet, or else wired directly to the
   Rio.   Either solution gets us periodic sonar measurements.     Sonar should be directed
   at the floor from the bottom of the ball handler with suffient protection to prevent it from
   getting broken during reverse hab dive.   It might be necessary to aim the unit slightly away
   from the robot to avoid picking up robot parts in the returns.   (Status:  we could continue
   to work on this if we have a few wiring harnesses to connect sonar to Rio.)

4. Limit switch to stop downward elevator motion.   This should be wired to the
   reverse limit switch pin of the master elevator drive motor controller #7 breakout.
   That is, unless motor forward drives the elevator down, then, instead is should be
   connected to the forward limit switch.

5. Sony eyecam pointed at vision targets on the hatch panel holes.    Will need a 
   light ring.   Can use 12v LED ring or piggy-back off
   of the Arduino on the electronics board.  (that would require 3-wire conductor
   running over the handler to power the ring.)
   Needs legit/protected mounting location and wiring over the cable management.

6. (scratch this) Dual sonar mounts on front of robot in a position that will permit the sonar to
   determine if the robot is square to the pickup delivery points.
    a. mounts
    b. three wires each, to Rio (5v power, ground, and to an analog input pin)
    
7. scratch lights.  No weight allowance for them.

8. Scratch encoder.   There appears to be insufficient will to get this done.

   Encoder mounted on the elevator drivetrain.  (need breakout connected to a motor
   controller powering the elevator #7.)
   
9. Balancing servos (coupled to flow-control valve)    These four servos are to be connected
   to the Rio (PWM pins 0-3).    If the location of the servos requires it, we'll need
   standard 3-wire extensions for the connection.  Servos already have 1 foot of wire on them
   that can be plugged directly into Rio PWM pins.
 
    Connected to Rio PWM pin numbers:
        0    Servo for front left piston flow control valve
        1    Servo for front right piston flow control valve
        2    Servo for back left piston flow control valve
        3    Servo for back right piston flow control valve

    
10. Motor controller ID assignments to be set/wired before giving the robot to software.
    
    Can ID for drivetrain:  (post weight-loss program)
      
     Left Side:    1, 2  (1 is master, 2 is follower)
     Right Side:   4, 5  (4 is master, 5 is follower)
     Elevator:     7, 8  (encoder breakout from 7, also for limit switch (at bottom))
     Ball Intake   9
       
     Pneumatics: (module: extend, retract)
            0: 0,1:     Front pistons (ganged left and right)
            0: 2,3:     Rear pistons (ganged left and right)
            0: 4,5:     Deploy Intake
            0: 6,7:     Hatchgrabber
