#  This file contains items that software plans to put on the robot
#  Items are list with an item description, cost, and weight.
#  These are to be inserted into the robot BOM (Bill of Materials)
#  so we can track that we are under cost and under weight.
#
#  Once we have some weights, we can decide on quantities and insert them
#  into the spreadsheet.
